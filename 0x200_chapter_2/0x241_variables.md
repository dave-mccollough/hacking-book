# 0x241 - Variables

- Variables are an object that holds data that can be changed
- Constants are variables who's value can't be changed once set
- All variables are stored in memory and their declarations allow the compiler to organize memory more efficiently
- **Everything is memory**
- Variables are given a type that describes the information meant to be stored in that variable
- Common types include
  - `int` - Integer values
  - `float` - Float values (decimal)
  - `char` - Single character values
- Variables are declared by using these keywords before listing the variables
  - Example
    - `int a,b;`
    - `float k;`
    - `char z;`
- Once variables are declared, they can be used
- Variables can be assigned values when they are declared or anytime aftward using the `=` operator.
  - Example
    `int a = 13, b;`
    `float k;`
    `char z = 'A';`
    `k = 3.14;`
    `z = 'w';`
    `b = a + 5;`

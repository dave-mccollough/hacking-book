# 0x232 - While/Until loops

- TO execute a set of instuctions more than once, you can use looping
- Looping requires a set of instuctions to telling it when to stop looping
  - Otherwise will loop infinite times
- **while loops**
  - Executes while a condition is `true`
  - Example:  Loop will only execute if `you are hungry` condition is true.
    `While (you are hungry)`
    `{`
        `Find some food;`
        `Eat some food;`
    `}`

- **until loops**
  - Inverted `while` loop
  - Not used in C - used in Perl
  - Example
    `Until (you are not hungry)`
    `{`
        `Find some food;`
        `Eat the food;`
    `}`
